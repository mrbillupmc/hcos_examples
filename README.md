# hcOS

hcOS (“Healthcare Operating System”) is a web-based software platform under development at UPMC. The hcOS platform makes it easy for app developers to build software solutions that access clinical data and clinical systems. Using hcOS you can build a variety of healthcare applications for clinicians, patients or healthcare administrators. You can learn more about hcOS at [https://enterprises.upmc.com/portfolio/hcos/](https://enterprises.upmc.com/portfolio/hcos/)
