# Getting started with hcOS

## hcOS

hcOS (“Healthcare Operating System”) is a web-based software platform under development at UPMC. The hcOS platform makes it easy for app developers to build software solutions that access clinical data and clinical systems. Using hcOS you can build a variety of healthcare applications for clinicians, patients or healthcare administrators. You can learn more about hcOS at [https://enterprises.upmc.com/portfolio/hcos/](https://enterprises.upmc.com/portfolio/hcos/)

## Let's Go

This example demonstrates everything you need to know in order to get started developing with hcOS in **9 minutes** or less. We'll use our access keys to retrieve Oauth2 tokens, search hcOS Documents, and retrieve hcOS Documents that are part of the search result set. Topics include:

* Load hcOS API configurations
* Retrieve Oauth2 Tokens
* hcOS Client Setup
* Search hcOS
* Process hcOS Search Results
* Retrieve hcOS Documents
